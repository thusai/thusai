ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Barath.

Iâ€™m exploring how software will build, test, and evolve itself. These projects help surface the constraints and architectures that make that future possible.

Right now, I focus on AI-native infrastructureâ€”LLM orchestration, developer automation, and agent workflows. I ship fast, validate real usage, and scale what proves valuable.

Previously,
- **Stanford University** â€” Research Fellow (â€™23â€“â€™24); explored observability frameworks for AI models
- **SageMaker (AWS)** â€” PM for model observability; launched drift tools that cut detection time
- **Prudential** â€” Built ensemble fraud engine that automated 80% claim reviews workflows
- **Toss** (Co-founder) â€” Launched a mealkit platform that scaled into a VC-backed B2B logistics engine

This GitHub is my playgroundâ€”expect raw code, working experiments, and continuous learning.

Active projects:
- **Aston** â€” A test engine for agentic IDEs like Cursor, Codex, and Claude; focused on diff-aware test suggestions
- **Protolang** â€” Experiments on agent communication protocols: symbol emergence, alignment and drifts

Weekend projects:
- **[Cordless](https://github.com/thusai/cordless)** â€” A CLI-native user loop tester for product teams
- **AgentTrace** â€” FinOps for LLM-native development (eval, training, inference cost tracking)
- **[LLM-Act](https://github.com/thusai/llm-act)** â€” Transform LLM responses into structured, executable CLI workflows
