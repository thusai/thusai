ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Barath.

Iâ€™m a PM who buildsâ€”experimenting with AI (LLMs, agent workflows, automation) by shipping actual demos.
I build to test ideas quickly, validate what works, and then collaborate with engineers to scale.

Previously built AI/ML observability tools at AWS (SageMaker), and analytics products in Banking.

This GitHub is my playgroundâ€”expect raw code, working experiments, and continuous learning.
