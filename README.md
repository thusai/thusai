ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Barath.

Iâ€™m a PM/Product builder experimenting with AI infra & tooling (LLM orchestration, dev-facing automatin, AI-native workflows) by shipping actual demos.
I build to test ideas quickly, validate what works, and then collaborate with engineers to scale.

Previously built AI/ML observability tools at AWS (SageMaker), fraud detection suite for Prudential (Insurance)

This GitHub is my playgroundâ€”expect raw code, working experiments, and continuous learning.

some active projects:
- **[Cordless](https://github.com/thusai/cordless)** â€” A CLI-native user loop tester for product teams, powered by LangGraph and Faker
- **[LLM-Act](https://github.com/thusai/llm-act)** â€” Transform LLM responses into structured, executable CLI workflows
- **[deeptype.online](https://deeptype.online/)** â€” Typing sprints, death mode, and custom panels for the Monkeytype community

some old projects:
- **AgentTrace** â€” FinOps for LLM-native development (eval, training, inference cost tracking)
- **LinkedOut** â€” Rethinking social graphs by engineering trust-weighted referrals, visibility loops, and team formation
